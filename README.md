## Introduction

Wemp is a modern local web development stack that brings [Nginx](https://nginx.org), [MariaDB](https://mariadb.org), and [PHP](https://www.php.net) to Windows with zero configuration.

Manage everything from the system tray by clicking the Wemp icon.

## Features

- **User-friendly Interface**: Designed for both beginners and experienced users.

## System Requirements

- Windows 10 or later (64-bit)
- Internet connection for downloading services

## Installation

1. Download and run the latest Wemp installer from the [Releases](https://github.com/electronfriends/wemp/releases/latest) page.
2. Choose the installation path where the services will be installed (default is `C:\Wemp`).
3. Required services will be downloaded and configured automatically.
4. Access your web server at http://localhost or manage your database at http://localhost/phpmyadmin.

## FAQs

### Will uninstalling Wemp delete my services and data?

No. Uninstalling Wemp only removes the application itself. Your services, all configurations, databases, and web files remain completely intact in their installation folder. This allows you to:

- Reinstall Wemp without losing any data
- Manually manage your services if needed
- Keep your development environment even without Wemp

If you want to completely remove everything, you'll need to manually delete the services folder (default: `C:\Wemp`) after uninstalling the application.

### How can I use PHP, MariaDB, and Nginx from the command line?

To use these services from the command line, you can easily add them to your PATH:

1. Click the **Wemp** icon in the system tray
2. Hover over **Wemp** in the menu
3. Click **Add Services to PATH**
4. Restart your terminal for the changes to take effect

After this, you can use commands like `php -v`, `mysql -u root`, and `nginx -t` from any terminal.

### Can I use a specific PHP version?

No, Wemp is designed to work as a complete, tested stack with the latest stable versions of all services. Using different PHP versions would break compatibility with phpMyAdmin and other integrated components. The application automatically manages updates to ensure you're always running secure, compatible versions of PHP, MariaDB, and Nginx that work together seamlessly.

### Why does the tray icon move to the hidden area after updating?

This is a Windows behavior caused by how Squirrel (our updater) works. Each update installs the application in a new versioned folder, which Windows treats as a completely new application even though it's the same program. You can drag the Wemp icon back to the visible tray area, and Windows will remember this preference until the next update.

### How do I move my services folder?

To move your services folder to a different location:

1. Stop Wemp completely (right-click tray icon â†’ Exit)
2. Manually move your services folder (e.g., from `C:\Wemp` to `D:\Development\Wemp`)
3. Start Wemp again
4. When prompted, select your new services folder location

Wemp doesn't handle folder moves automatically to prevent unexpected failures or potential file losses during the transfer process.
