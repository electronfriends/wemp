## FAQs

### Couldn't download service: invalid signature?

If you get this error during the first installation, there is now a newer version of this service and the old version can no longer be downloaded.

Please create a new [issue](https://github.com/electronfriends/wemp/issues/new) so that we can take care of updating the version as soon as possible.
